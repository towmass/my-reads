# MyReads Project

This browser-based app allows you to store your previous, current and future readings while also providing you an option to add some books.

This is a Udacity student's project, therefore Udacity React lessons were used in process of learning given topics and developing this app, meaning a vast majority of code corresponds to the previous project from the React course, in which "coding alongside with the tutor" method was applied.

Student's goal for this project was to successfully implement obtained information from the previous lessons.

This web application was built by using HTML, CSS, Javascript (+ React), whereas Udacity provided the starter template to work with including their course lessons for required topics.

Please note that once the page is refreshed, the current content of shelves will appear again after searching and manipulating with some book - this indicates that the app should be used when the reader experiences some new "state" with the given book or books and want to record it to his personal database.
